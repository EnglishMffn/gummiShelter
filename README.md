# GummiShelter Custom Divi Theme
My COMM 310 final project utilizing SASS, Airbnb linting, Python, Lottie animations, and Gulp tools for image optimization, css validation, and SASS transpiling.

## Theme Structure

### 'Stylesheets' folder 
Inside here you'll find all my .sass files. I tried to follow a simplified SASS 7-1 structure.

### 'Python' folder
I wrote a quick python script to help me generate random Gummybears.

### 'fonts' folder
My custom fonts sit here. Not included in repo.

### 'style.css'
The compiled sass output

### 'images' and 'dist' folder
Images folder is for my raw files, and dist is the compressed versions of the images

### 'gulpfile.js'
My gulp tools to optimize images in the 'images' folder, compile my SASS, and validate CSS.

### 'logs' folder
CSS validation results are output here

### 'scripts' folder
My custom lottie animation files live in here
