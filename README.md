# Eborall Custom Theme
Hi Brother Lybbert!
I've been trying to save some time by using a more modern stack workflow using Sass, airbnb linting, a custom page theme, and gulp for compiling/testing.
I did this because I found the divi pagebuilder quite cumbersome.

## Theme Structure

### 'Stylesheets' folder 
Inside here you'll find all my .sass files. I tried to follow a modified 7-1 structure.

### 'Python' folder
I wrote a quick python script to help me generate some random gummybears

### 'fonts' folder
My custom font sits here

### 'style.css'
The compiled sass output

### 'images' folderr
Images folder is for my raw files, and dist is the compressed versions of the images

### 'gulpfile.js'
My gulp commands to optimize images in the 'images' folder and to compile my sass.
